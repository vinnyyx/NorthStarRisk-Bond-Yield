# NorthStarRisk-Bond-Yield
Project for NorthStarRisk Bond Yield calculations.

Approach 1: First Order Bond Yield Estimation

Approach 2: Modified denominator of First Order Estimation

Approach 3: 3 point interpolation (choose yields of 1%, 4%, and 7%) and conduct interpolation

Approach 4: Use Coupon Spread as an estimation metric

Later approaches: 

Approach 3 works well with smaller time windows compared to approach 4. Thus, we will be combining the 2 in our newest approaches.

Approach 5: Use Coupon Spread as an estimation metric
